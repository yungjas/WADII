    <!-- if your js files (especially external ones) are huge, then its best to put them in the body tag -->
    <!-- html renders in a top down format, which means if big js files are put here in the head tag, it might cause the page to take a very long time to load which harms user experience -->
    <!-- hence its best to put big js files in the body tag (specifically before the closing body tag), this allows the content to be loaded first, allowing the user to look at the content while the js files are loaded -->
    <!-- however if your js files are small aka like the ones below, then theres no harm in putting them in the head tag -->
    <!-- BUT if you have js codes that needs to run when the page loads, you can place it inside head -->
    <script>
        function hi(){
            alert('Hi there!'); 
            alert('Hi again!'); 
            var x = 7; 
            alert(x);
